# Board at desk - single dev description  #

Board at desk - single dev is an effort to ease the deployment of KernelCI and LAVAv2 allowing
a developer with a board connected to its machine test kernels. 
In order to do so, a VM has been created with all the tools and configurations required. 
The current technology used to create that VM is Vagrant.
